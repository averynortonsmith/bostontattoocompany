Irina has been an artist for as long as she can remember. After graduating with a BFA in Illustration from the Rhode Island School of Design - during which she was selected for the European Honors program in Rome- she focused on painting before turning her attention to tattoos. In 2017 she joined Boston Tattoo Company as an apprentice and gained her professional license in early 2019. Since then, she has focused on honing her craft and pushing her artwork to become an impressive tattoo artist in her own right.
