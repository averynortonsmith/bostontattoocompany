I'm a tattooist working out of The Boston Tattoo Company in Somerville, MA and Precision Body Arts in Nashua, NH. I'm a printmaker by school and trade and trying to find the perfect balance of being a tattooist and being a printmaker. For the time being, I am trying to make every tattoo I do better than the last.

I consider myself extremely lucky- I am surrounded by amazing artists and find myself learning something new everyday. I'm constantly creating, learning, and always working on becoming a more well rounded visual artist.
