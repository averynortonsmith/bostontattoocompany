Josh Hagan is based out of Tucson, AZ and is the artist/owner of Legacy Tattoo. Along with his wife & Sullen Angel tattoo model Leigha Hagan, they travel the country attending many tattoo conventions and expos. Josh will come to the Boston area & work out of our studio when he’s already on the east coast, which lately has been about every other month.
He’s best known for his color semi-realism, but is equally talented in black & gray. Though he has tattooed every image imaginable, he loves doing futuristic, sci-fi & horror related imagery.
