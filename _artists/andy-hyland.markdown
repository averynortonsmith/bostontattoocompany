I’m currently tattooing at Boston Tattoo Company in Medford, Ma. I enjoy many styles of tattooing. If you are interested in making an appointment with me please stop by the shop in person. I’m at the shop every day but Wednesday and Sunday. On Saturdays I usually exclusively do small walk-in tattoos. My current rate is $175 per hour for tattoos estimated at 3 hours or longer. Blackwork is $200 an hour, and smaller pieces can be quoted when you come in. Some custom pieces may require time for me to draw something up for you. Feel free to stop by the shop if you have any questions or ideas regarding a tattoo, I’m glad to help.

P.S. I’m a lot friendlier than I look. I’m a real ray of sunshine, ask anyone.
