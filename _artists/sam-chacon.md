Sam Chacon was born & raised in Southern California. His father was an artist all his life & he mentored Sam in the world of art & helped surface his artistic abilities. To this day, they both exchange art ideas & paint together when the time allows.

Sam picked up a tattoo machine a little more than 5 years ago & never looked back. Tattooing has become part of his lifestyle & he wouldnâ€™t have it any other way. Having worked at a handful of great tattoo shops throughout the years, he has learned valuable tattooing techniques from amazing tattoo artists like our fellow guest artist, Carl Grace.

Sam Chacon specializes in high-end custom tattoos and portraits, though he also loves when clients let him freehand a tattoo as well. Sam opened his own tattoo studio called Sanctum in 2014 and it has quickly risen to be one of the best studios in Southern CA.
