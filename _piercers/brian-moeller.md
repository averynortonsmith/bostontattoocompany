Hello, My name is Brian Moeller, and I am a Professional Body Piercer…
​
I’ve been piercing professionally for over 8 years originating in South Jersey but since 2008, I’ve been working in the Greater Boston Area. My piercing techniques vary using mostly hands free or minimal tool techniques as well as surface piercings and surface anchors. I have been piercing at The Boston Tattoo Company in Davis Square since the day it opened back in June 2010. Since then, we’ve been awarded as “The Best of Boston” by the Boston Phoenix in 2011 and 2012 until the papers end.

For the last 5 years I’ve been volunteering at the annual Association of Professional Piercers Conference in Las Vegas and as of March 2013, I officially became a Member of the APP. As of 2015, I’ve been serving on multiple committees that help plan the Annual Conference as well as instructed my first class.

The only thing I enjoy more than poking holes is to pierce people with really nice, high quality jewelry. So instead of trying to pierce some random spot on your body because “No One Else Has It Yet”, lets make your piercing really unique by putting something really awesome that will really make an impression visually.

Everyone has seen a nose piercing, not many have seen a nose piercing with a gorgeous piece of jewelry.
