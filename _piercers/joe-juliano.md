Joseph Juliano has been piercing professionally in the Boston area for about 4 years. Since high school, body art was one of his main interests. After working in the industry for several years, his main priority became quality. Being able to offer his clients high quality jewelry and an exceptional piercing experience are his goals as a skin technician. It’s not everyday you are walking down the street and have to turn your head to admire the bling on somebody’s body, but that’s how he strives to make it.

Joe’s piercing techniques vary, but he prefers to perform the majority of his work freehand, utilizing minimal tools. He is frequently studying to become more efficient in his craft to give his clients an experience worth remembering.

Come on down and treat yourself! You deserve it!
