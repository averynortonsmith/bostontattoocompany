# TATTOO FAQ

#### How long does a tattoo take to heal and what can I expect during that time?

A brand new tattoo will feel like a sunburn during the first day or two. The tattoo may form a layer of dry skin or lightly scab within a few days- this is normal. Do not try to remove any scabs or dry skin by picking at it or scrubbing in the shower- Let your tattoo heal by itself! You should be fully healed within about 2 weeks.

#### What do I need to do after I get a tattoo?

The tattoo artist will advise you on specifically what you will need to do after the tattoo. In general, until the tattoo is healed, you will need to protect the tattoo from direct sunlight, avoid prolonged wetness (swimming, bath tubs/hot tubs,etc) and no petroleum jelly as the initial healing agent. We do sell a specific aftercare cream that will help get the tattoo off to a great start. Don’t be cheap and buy a $1.59 tube of A&D ointment at the local pharmacy- ointment has petroleum jelly in it and that is a no no…

#### Does it hurt?

Every person is different, but generally speaking, the anticipation of any pain is usually worse than what it actually feels like.

#### Is it safe to get a tattoo?

Yes, it is safe to get a tattoo. Every tool and piece of equipment is sterilized immediately after each tattoo is completed. All tattoo needles are 1-time use only. They arrive to us from the manufacturer in individual pre-sealed pouches and are opened up right in front of you.

#### What kind of tattoo designs can I choose from?

We have thousands of pre-made flash designs in the shop, but all of our tattoo artists do custom artwork. If you have an idea, bring in a rough sketch or picture and the tattoo artist can draw something up for you. We will not tattoo any hate or gang related imagery.

#### How much does a tattoo cost?

Our studio’s minimum price is $100, depending on the part of the body to be tattooed. The individual pricing of a tattoo must be done in person however and cannot be done over the phone, through email or social media messaging.

#### How old do I have to be to get a tattoo or piercing?

Tattoo: Sorry- no one under 18- it’s the law. State/Gov. issued ID required. Piercing: 18 years of age with State/Gov. issued ID. If under 18, a parent/legal guardian must be present with the *minor’s birth certificate, *a State/Gov. issued ID for the parent/guardian and *a picture ID for the minor.

#### What is considered a proper form or ID?

A state issued driver’s license or state ID card, a military ID or a passport. Many forms of ID are valid for 5 or more years and though the ID presented may be valid, the photo must be current enough to match the person presenting the ID.

#### Can I bring someone with me for support?

Unfortunately, the only person allowed in the tattoo area is the customer receiving the artwork. Friends and family may wait in our lobby. Children are NOT allowed in the store- Period! It’s not that we don’t like children, it’s just that this is just not the right environment for an impressionable young mind…

#### Can I just walk in to get a tattoo/piercing, or do I need to make an appointment?

Piercings are handled only as walk-ins (because they are so quick). For tattoos, we take both walk-ins and appointments. Granted, not every tattoo can be done as a walk-in due to time constraints, artist availability or design needs, but we will do our best to work with you.

# PIERCING FAQ

#### What Do I need to bring to get pierced?

Any over the age of 18 needs only a Valid, State or Government Issued, photo I.D.

Some Examples are:

- Driver’s License
- Passport
- Military I.D.
- School I.D. accompanied with a Birth Certificate

Anyone under 18 years old must at least be in High School and must also bring:

- Photo I.D. (High School I.D. or Driver’s License)
- Birth Certificate
- Their Biological Mother or Father must have their Driver’s License as well and be present to sign a release form

*Any Minor getting pierced must have all three documents EVERY TIME they wish to get a piercing, NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.*

#### Age Restrictions for Certain Piercings:

- 18 years and older for any Surface piercings, Surface Anchors, Nipple Piercings, and Genital Piercings
- 16 years and older for Tongue, Septum, and Eyebrow
- 14 years and older for most other piercings

#### Basic After Care Recommendations

A premade, piercing specific solution work excellently. Simple Care is a great example of one of those products. You can also make a solution at home using sea salt and distilled water however, most people are usually very busy and don’t always have time to make this.

For the first few weeks, you may see some fluid or some “crustiness” on the jewelry. As attractive as this sounds, it is also normal, this is your body’s natural reaction to a new piercing. Spray (or soak) the piercing once for about 5-10 minutes, then gently wipe away any grossness from the piercing site.

This is best done twice a day for the first month, once a day for the second month, and then every so often after that.

#### Important side note:

Many doctors may not understand body piercings. In that same light, Body piercers are not doctors.

The suggestions given in this form are based on the experience of professionals in the body piercing industry and are not intended to be presented as medical advice.
